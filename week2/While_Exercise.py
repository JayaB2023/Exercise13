    print(myl.pop() * 2)


# nothing inside pop removes last element of list

# code explained
# pop () on a list removes and returns the last item
# click into buggy on top right hand side ad press step into my code and then step in
# pop () - pop off the last name in the list
# while my list is true take the last number and multiply it by two, will keep going until all the right hand side numbers are on the left
