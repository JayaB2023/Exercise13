# Python is a dynamic language
# It's the opposite of a strongly-typed language (java, c#)
# java example
# string greeting = "Good Morning!";

# a single equals as below is an assignment operator (right associative i.e., read the stuff to the right first)
message = "Yay! It's nearly the weekend!!!"

# print is a built-in FUNCTION
# functions do useful tasks
# functions can accept inputs
# inputs go inside the brackets (hello Jaya and Victoria)
# functions can return something (output)
# the print function displays text streams to the standard output stream (stdout)

print("Hello Jaya and Victoria")

# variables - values can change often
# a variable is an organising tool as boxes you can name

print("Hi")

print(message)

print(message)

# How to create a variable to store a lucky number
lucky_number = 13
my_name = 'Jaya'
victoria_likes_broccoli = False
# How to create a variable to store someone else's lucky number

pams_name = 'Pam'
pam_likes_broccoli = True

print(my_name)
print(lucky_number)

print(my_name + "'s lucky number is:"+ str(lucky_number))

print(2 + 6)
# print(lucky_number + pams_lucky_number)
# print(my_name + lucky_number) (adding because they are both numbers)
print(my_name +  ' ' + pams_name)
